SSO Login

Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication method that enables users to securely authenticate with multiple applications and websites by using just one set of credentials.

With SSO, end-users time and efforts get minimized as they do not need to constantly sign in and out separately into a variety of apps.

Sumsub gives you the ability to control and manage accounts on your service side. Re-authentication is not required when authorizing in Sumsub dashboard.
